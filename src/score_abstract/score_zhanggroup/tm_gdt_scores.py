"""
Class that returns the scores from the Zhanggroup code to compute :
    - TM-score: a metric to assess the topological similarity of protein structures.
            This is here associated to RNA structures.
    - GDT-TS score (Global Distance Test Total Score): the sum of percent of residues that are
    within the 1, 2, 4 and 8A sphere between a superimposed model and native reference structure,
    divided by 4.

The original code can be found at the following website:
        https://zhanggroup.org/TM-score/
