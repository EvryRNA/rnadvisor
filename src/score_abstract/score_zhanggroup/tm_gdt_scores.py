Class that returns the scores from the Zhanggroup code to compute :
    GDT-TS score (Global Distance Test Total Score): the sum of percent of residues that are
    within the 1, 2, 4 and 8A sphere between a superimposed model and native reference structure,
    divided by 4.

The original code can be found at the following website:
